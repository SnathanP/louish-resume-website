Hello world! Freshly graduated from EPITA, I just not wanted to create and enhanced solutions to answers company needs, I wanted to see beyond the code, how it will become parts of the life of a company, for its consumers, for its customers and how it was brought to them.

As an engineer, the why is central to my approach and enriches myself with a lot of experience but also allows me to re-think the needs and processes at its origins.

Does your company has a story to tell?
