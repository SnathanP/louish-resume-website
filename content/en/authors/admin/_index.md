Hello world! Graduated from EPITA in 2021, I was able to travel into different companies, ecosystem, tech stacks and really find my way: Creating and enhancing solutions to answer company needs, I want to see beyond the code, how it will become part of the daily life of a company, for its consumers, for its customers and how it was brought to them.

As an engineer, the why is central to my approach and enriches myself with a lot of experiences and contexts but also allows me to re-think the needs and processes at its origin.

Does your company has a story to tell?
